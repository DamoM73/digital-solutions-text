> Central to problem-based learning is the provision or identification of suitably challenging, subject-specific, context-relevant, real-world problems. Student engagement with these problems facilitates student learning of Digital Solutions subject matter. (syllabus)

To engage in these problems Digital solutions prescribes a specific problem-solving process - EDGE (Explore, Develop, Generate and Evaluate).

> The process is iterative, proceeds through a number of phases, requiring students to explore problems, develop ideas, generate components and digital solutions, and evaluate personal, social and economic impacts, components and digital solutions. (syllabus)
