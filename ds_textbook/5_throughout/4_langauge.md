# Use Technical Language

Below is some technology specific language. You should aim to use these throughout your assessments:

- **abstraction:** identify the relevant information and eliminate the unnecessary details (eg. the get_password method **abstracts** the processes of opening the passwords file, reading the content, matching the username and returning the password by hiding these processes).
- **algorithmic thinking:** a step-by-step process to solve the problem (eg. the get_password methods' **algorithm** is opening the passwords file, reading the content, matching the username, then returning the password).
- **constraint:** a restriction on the degree of freedom you have in providing a solution (eg. **constraints** placed by the client on the project include using producing a desktop application and being functional using only a keyboard).
- **decomposition:** breaking down complex problems into more manageable parts (eg. the get_password method **decomposes** into opening the passwords file, reading the content, matching the username and returning the password).
- **economic impact:** impacts that effect an economic system at a local, national or global level (eg. the Covid Check-in app had an **economic impact** by minimising lock-downs and allowing businesses to open more often).
- **environmental impacts:** impacts that effect living and nonliving natural systems, including ecosystems, land, air and water (eg. the Containers For Change solution has had an **environmental impact** by encouraging users to recycle bottles.
- **functional requirements:** define the specific behaviours, responses, information, rules, or operations of a solution (eg. having an user login is one of the **functional requirements**).
- **input:** how data enters a system (eg. The use of a check-box restricts **input** options, reducing user error.).
- **limitation:** concerned with what the environment can actually do, or what does the development environment allow to occur (eg. the application must be developed using Python and run on Windows OS).
- **nonfunctional requirements:** specify the manner or the environment in which a solution is intended to operate (eg. following the Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines (WCAG) is one of the **nonfunctional requirements**).
- **output:** how data exits a system (eg. The get_password method will **output** the password for the provided username).
- **pattern recognition:** analyzing data and identifying similarities and connections among its different parts (eg. the methods for the number buttons follow a similar **pattern**, hence they can consolidated into one method).
- **personal impacts:** impacts that change the way that a person does something or alters their opinions, knowledge or wellbeing (eg. the Covid Check-in app has a **personal impact** of informing users if they have been in an exposure site).
- **prescribed criteria:** those criteria that are provided or placed on a project by the client (eg. the prescribe criteria include completion within six weeks, user login with a capacity to create new accounts and reset passwords, and a UI that follows the (WCAG)).
- **process:** how data is manipulated (eg. The inputted text will be **processed** to ensure it is valid).
- **scope:** the scope defines the boundaries of the system (or problem) that is being addressed (eg. the scope of the Covid Check-in App has been expanded to also include the user's vaccination status).
- **self-determined criteria** are any criteria that are developed and are not prescribed (eg. self-determined criteria include storing information in a database, hashing passwords, and will be programmed using python).
- **social impacts:** impacts that alter the well-being of the surrounding and wider community (eg. the Covid Check-in App had a **social impact** by assisting contact tracers to minimise the spread of Covid19 in Queensland). 
- **user interface (UI):** the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device (eg. the **UI** will consist of a main screen and two dialogue boxes).
- **user's needs:** express people's goals, values and aspirations (eg. implementing a username and password system, meets the **user's need** for security).
- **user persona:** fictional representations of the primary users that guide design decisions (eg. the UNI colours take into account the Michelle **persona's** colour blindness)
