# Identify Requirements

```{admonition} Tools used:
:class: attention
- mind maps
- requirments table
```
## For Unit 1
At this stage of the exploration you should have a clear idea of what the project demands of you.

Identify the function and non-functional requirements that the project is explicitly and implicitly asking for and add them to the mind map under requirements.

Now expand the requirements using the Requirements Table under the headings of must, should, could and won't.

## For Unit 2 to 4
In addition to the Unit 1 requirements, you also need to 

```{admonition} Unit 1 subject matter covered:
- analyse a given problem to identify the requirements of the solution
- analyse a given problem to identify the user perspective and user-experience requirements
- analyse a given problem to identify technical issues of the problem that influence the user-interface requirements
{cite}`queenslandcurriculumassessmentauthority_2017_digital`
```

```{admonition} Unit 2 subject matter covered:
- determine manageable aspects of a problem through decomposition, pattern recognition and analysis of programming options including data models, and storage and output requirements
- analyse problems associated with data insertion, including variations in data formats, data structures, validation rules and data requirements
- recognise the elements needed for a data-driven solution, including programming requirements, e.g. SQL  and algorithms
- recognise the elements needed for a data-driven solution, including system requirements, e.g. platforms, connections, hardware and data stores
- recognise the elements needed for a data-driven solution, including the data that is required from real-world data sources, e.g. files, peripheral devices, online sources and users
