### Data models
Data modelling is a process used to define and analyse data requirements.

Data modelling requires the organization of data into tables, and accounts for access, performance and storage details. 

> Data modelling defines not just data elements, but also their 
structures and the relationships between them. {cite}`wikipediacontributors_2019_data`

> Data modelling helps in the visual representation of data and 
enforces business rules, regulatory compliances, and government policies on the data. Data Models ensure consistency in naming conventions, default values, semantics, security while ensuring quality of the data. {cite}`taylor_2018_what`

The data model emphasizes on what data is needed and how it should be organized instead of what operations will be performed on data. Data Model is like an architect's building plan, which helps to build 
conceptual models and set a relationship between data items.



In this course we will focus on creating data models using Entity-relationship models. 
The primary goal of using data model are:
- Ensure that all data objects required by the database are accurately represented. Omission of 
data will lead to creation of faulty reports and produce incorrect results.
- To identify missing and redundant data. (Guru99, 2021)
