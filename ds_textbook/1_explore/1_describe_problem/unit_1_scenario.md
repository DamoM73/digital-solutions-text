# Unit 1: Learning Scenario

```{admonition} Mikey
:class: danger
Meet Mikey. Mikey is a 30 year-old guy who rents an inner city unit and works in customer support. Mikey in an introvert, and he finds that by the end of his day, he is "all talked out". He's rarely in the mood for socialising, and just wants to "decompress" at home. 

On a recent camping trip Mikey rediscovered hangman. Sure, he played the game at school, but he never realised how much he enjoyed playing it. He would love nothing more than coming home each day and playing hangman to relax, but that would involve interacting with people. Mikey is looking for a way to play hangman by himself.

## Is it a digital problem?
The problem involves:
- The input of data
  - Words
  - User letter choice
- The processing of data
  - check if letters are in the word
  - check if the word has been solved
  - check if the gallows have been completed
- The output of data
  - display of correct guesses
  - display of gallows
  - display of the unguessed dashes

Therefore the problem is one that can be solved with a Digital Solution.
