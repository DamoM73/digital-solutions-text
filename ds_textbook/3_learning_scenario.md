# Learning Scenario

We will use a scenario to assist in learning the content of this text. This scenario will develop as we move through the text, evolving to present new issues relevant to the context of each unit. Each subsequent scenario builds upon the previous scenarios, allow for students to use the tools and work they have previously developed.
