# Unit 1: Generate Code
```{admonition} Students will:
- generate user interfaces by investigating and applying useability principles
- explore the use of a procedural text-based language for writing and modifying code and using existing code blocks or statements
- explore the use of a procedural text-based language for interpreting programming language rules and syntax
- explore the use of a procedural text-based language for analysing and critiquing the end result of code statements using input or output evidence, i.e. runtime evidence
- explore functions and procedures with efficient and maintainable code that includes reuseable coded components
- explore functions and procedures with efficient and maintainable code that responds to keyboard and mouse events
- explore functions and procedures with efficient and maintainable code that uses variables, Selection structures, counted loops, while loops and single, multi-branch and nested conditional logic/statements
- explore functions and procedures with efficient and maintainable code that uses operators, including arithmetic (+, –, *, /, integer, modulus, exponent), comparison (<, >, <=, >=, equal, not equal) and logical (AND, OR, NOT)
- explore the purpose of code statements by writing code and using existing code blocks or statements
- explore object/event triggers and develop explanations about their effect/s on user interfaces
- apply the use of arithmetic operators: +, –, *, /, integer, modulus, exponent
- apply the use of comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=, equal, not equal
- apply the use of logical operators: AND, OR, NOT
- output information to the screen in text-based or visual formats
- generate components of a solution by using existing code or writing new code statements
- generate modified code in response to new or existing information
- generate functions/procedures with efficient and maintainable code that includes reuseable code blocks or statements and responses to keyboard and mouse events
- generate Selection structures, counted loops, while loops, and single, multi-branch and nested conditional logic statements
- generate local and global variables
- generate a prototype digital solution in response to a problem
