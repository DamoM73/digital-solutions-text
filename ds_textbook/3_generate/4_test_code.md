# Test Code

```{admonition} Tools use:
:class: attention 
- Integrated Testing Table
- Unit Testing Table
```

## For Units 1 to 4
You will need to test the code that you have generated to ensure the reliability of your code.

During the generate phase your will need to undertake both:
- Integrated testing
- Unit testing

The results of these tests should be recorded in two tables

Integrated Testing table  
![Integrated Testing](./assets/integrated_testing.png)

Unit Testing table
![Unit Testing](./assets/unit_testing.png)


## For Units 2 to 4
Continue to complete both unit testing and integration testing.

In addition we will need to explicitly test the code for:
- Efficiency - uses minimal resources to solve identified problem
- Maintainability - code that is easy to read and modify
- Reliability - operate without producing errors or fail at a task

You also need to test your application against the useability principles.
- Accessibility: the ability to be used by many different people, even people with disabilities.
- Effectiveness: the ability of users to use the system to do the work they need to do.
- Safety: the ability for users to make errors and recover from the mistake.
- Utility: the ability of the system to provide all the functionality that users need.
- Learnability: how easy the system is to learn


```{admonition} Unit 1 subject matter covered:
