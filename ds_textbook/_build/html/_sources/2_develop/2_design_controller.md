```

```{admonition} Unit 1 subject matter covered:
- recognise and describe programming syntax and rules
- understand that simple algorithms consist of input, process and output at various stages
- understand and use assignment, sequence, selection, condition, iteration, and modularisation
- represent algorithms using pseudocode by identifying and describing the steps and their behaviour in the algorithm
- represent algorithms using pseudocode by identifying and explaining the algorithmic steps required for a programmed solution
- symbolise algorithms and interrelationships with sketches and diagrams
- understand the five basic features of programming â€“ variables, control structures, data structures, syntax and libraries and classes.
- recognise, describe and use good programming practices, including dependability, efficiency, testing, debugging, error correction, coding conventions including commenting, consistent naming conventions, code simplicity and portability
- identify and describe the purpose of code syntax and rules
- identify and describe the scope and use of local and global variables
- identify and describe code object/event triggers and their effect on user interfaces

```{admonition} Unit 2 subject matter covered:
- symbolise well-ordered and unambiguous algorithms using pseudocode for procedural code that processes data for insertion into a database or manipulates or displays retrieved data
- symbolise well-ordered and unambiguous algorithms using pseudocode for user interaction, data validation and data presentation
{cite}`queenslandcurriculumassessmentauthority_2017_digital`
```

```{admonition} Unit 3 subject matter covered:
- recognise and describe program components such as objects, event handlers and multimedia assets 
- recognise and describe external data stores such as file structures or object libraries
- recognise and describe internal data structures such as arrays, lists and dictionaries
- analyse modularity and readability of program modules
- apply computational thinking processes, e.g. creating, debugging, persevering and collaborating to identify possible algorithmic approaches

```

```{admonition} Unit 4 subject matter covered:
- symbolise and explain how application sub-systems, e.g. front end, back end, work together to constitute a solution
- develop simple Caesar, Polyaphabetic (e.g. Vignere and Gronsfeld), and one-time pad encryption algorithms
- evaluate by desk checking algorithms to predict the output for a given input, identify errors and validate algorithms
