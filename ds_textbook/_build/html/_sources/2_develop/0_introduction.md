# Develop Introduction
```{admonition} Tools used to complete the Develop phase:
:class: attention
- Mockups
- Activity Diagrams
- Class Diagrams
- IPO Tables
- Pseudocode
- Desk-checking
- Data Flow Diagrams
- Entity Relationship Diagrams
- Data Dictionaries
- Relational Schemas
```

The develop phase involves students creating new understanding and identifying possible solutions using design, systems, and abstraction and algorithmic computational thinking processes. Students evaluate personal, social and economic impacts, components and digital solutions against criteria throughout the develop phase to make decisions and refine the user experience and technical operation of components of the solution.

```{admonition} To develop ideas, students:
- use design thinking to visualise ideas and synthesise information and ideas in response to a digital problem by using drawing and creative skills to represent and communicate ideas
- acquire required information, tools and skills to implement a solution plan
- use computational thinking to apply abstraction procedures to problem components
- use computational thinking to express algorithms
- use systems and design thinking to develop ideas about components and solutions to test conceptual models
- use systems and design thinking to generate creative ideas, identify a solution and evaluate ideas that best meet the criteria for success. {cite}`qcaa_2017_digital`
