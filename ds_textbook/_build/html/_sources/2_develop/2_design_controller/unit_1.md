# Unit 1 - Design Algorithms
```{admonition} Students will:
- recognise and describe programming syntax and rules
- understand that simple algorithms consist of input, process and output at various stages
- understand and use assignment, sequence, selection, condition, iteration, and modularisation
- represent algorithms using pseudocode by identifying and describing the steps and their behaviour in the algorithm
- represent algorithms using pseudocode by identifying and explaining the algorithmic steps required for a programmed solution
- symbolise algorithms and interrelationships with sketches and diagrams
- understand the five basic features of programming â€“ variables, control structures, data structures, syntax and libraries and classes.
- recognise, describe and use good programming practices, including dependability, efficiency, testing, debugging, error correction, coding conventions including commenting, consistent naming conventions, code simplicity and portability
- identify and describe the purpose of code syntax and rules
- identify and describe the scope and use of local and global variables
- identify and describe code object/event triggers and their effect on user interfaces
