# Describe the Problem
```{admonition} Students will:
- understand the constituents of a digital problem
```

```{admonition} Tools used: 
- mind maps
```
Once we have established that the a digital solution is applicable to the problem, it is important to have a clear understanding of what the problem is.

To describe the problem we will use the TOSCA framework which considers the problem through the lenses of:
- Trouble
- Owner
- Success Criteria
- Constraints
- Actors

We record these details on our mind map.
