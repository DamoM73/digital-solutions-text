Describing the problem is an important first step in developing a digital solution. There are uncountable examples of failed solutions due to the designer solving a different problem to the one they were supposed to solve. Therefore the first step in our problem solving process is to clearly, and succinctly.

We do this using our mind map. Create a child node off your topic, and call it **Problem Description** then make a child node for each point you can identify about the problem presented to you. Each node should only cover one fact.
