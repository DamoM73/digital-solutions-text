# Unit 1: Describing the Problem

## What are digital problems?

> Problem solving in technology-rich environments involves using digital technology, communication tools and networks to acquire and evaluate information, communicate with others and perform practical tasks. It requires the ability to solve problems for personal, social and economic purposes through the setting of appropriate goals and plans and by the accessing and making use of information through computers and computer networks.{cite}`piaacexpertgroupinproblemsolvingintechnologyrichenvironments_2009_piaac`

> Digital problems are therefore those problems that are solvable using information and communication technologies. These digital solutions can use a wide variety of developed and developing contexts such as web applications, mobile applications, interactive media and intelligent systems. {cite}`digitaltechnologieshub_topics`

What distinguishes a digital problem is that the solution consists of digital hardware and software working together to form a digital system.

In a digital system:
- data goes in (input)
- data is manipulated (process)
- data is sent out (output)

## Scope
The scope of the project provides detail about how the solution will address the problem and what types of things will be produced or delivered. The scope defines the boundaries of the system (or problem) that is being addressed.

The scope includes:
- **Problem Statement** - The problem statement is an overall descriptive statement about what needs to be solved. It includes a justification for the project (explains why is it being undertaken in the first place).
- **Objective** - These are the overall project goals that will meet the needs of your customers. They are described in terms of the product or service that will exist at the end of the project. The developer needs to understand the objectives because it gives a basis for any decision making in the future. It also allows the developer to evaluate the most recent status of the project against the original objectives which had already been set.
- **Deliverables** - The deliverables are the objects are that need to be produced. It may also describe the key features and what client needs are being met though them.
- **Constraints and Limitations** - What are the barriers or things that must be adhered to. These are the requirement specifications for the project. These are summarized and typically involve a technical description. The requirements also have descriptions which are functional so that the project participants can implement them. These might include such things as the platforms the projects is being developed for and the programming languages involved.
- **Timeline** - How long the project will run for and any specific milestones or checkpoints along the way.

### Problem Statement
> A problem statement is a concise and unbiased description of the problem or issues a process improvement project seeks to address. 

How to write a problem statement
Use this step-by-step guide to craft your problem statement:

Identify the problem.
Begin your statement with your ideal situation.
Describe current gaps.
State the consequences of the problem.
Propose addressing the problem.
1. Identify the problem
Before you write your problem statement, you must first identify the problem.

2. Begin your statement with your ideal situation
Next, your problem statement should identify the ideal environment if the problem didn't exist. Ideally, this section should also describe what your company hopes to accomplish through this process improvement project.

3. Describe the current gaps
Now it's onto your problem statement's reality section. Your goal is to be concise and identify what the current environment looks like and then focus on the 5Ws and H - what the problem is, what is causing the problem, why it's an issue and who first realised the problem.

4. State the consequences of the problem
Next is the consequences section of your problem statement, where you should quantify and highlight the consequences of the problem. Use this section to identify specific numbers, such as the time or revenue lost or the number of resources wasted. It's important for your consequences section to include concrete numbers that support your claims.

5. Propose addressing the problem
Finally, end your problem statement with a proposal section. In this section, identify how your company will make progress towards reaching the desired goals and accomplishing its ideal environment. While you may decide to disclose several solutions in this section, it's more important to focus on identifying how your company will find those solutions than it is to identify the specific resolution to implement.
