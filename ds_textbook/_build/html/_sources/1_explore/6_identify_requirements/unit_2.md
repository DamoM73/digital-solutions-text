# Unit 2: Identify Requirements
In addition to the requirements from Unit 1, you also need to consider

## Programming options

### Data models
> Data modeling (data modelling) is the process of creating a data model for the data to be stored in a database. This data model is a conceptual representation of Data objects, the associations between different data objects, and the rules. {cite}`taylor_2018_what` 

It is defined as an abstract model that organizes:
- data description
- data semantics
- consistency constraints 

Data models emphasizes on what data is needed and how it should be organized instead of what operations will be performed on data. 

The primary goal of using data model are:
- ensuring that all data objects required by the database are accurately represented.
- help designing the database at the logical level
- defining the relational tables, primary and foreign keys and stored procedures.\
- providing a clear picture of the base data and can be used by database developers to create a physical level
- identifying missing and redundant data
- making IT infrastructure upgrades and maintenance cheaper and faster

In this course we will be creating data models using Enity Relationship models.

### Storage
Data storage requirements can relate to either policies and procedures that need to be adhered to for 
the safe storage, use and destruction of data and also to the physical and software requirements of 
storing that information. 

The safe storage of data is atopic that will be more closely investigated in Unit 4. For Unit 2 we are concern with storing data in way that ensures:
- data integrity
- data validity
- data reliability

You will need to consider:
- Where will the data be stored (locally or remotely on a server)?
- What file format will be used to store the data?
- How will the data be backed-up?
- What security will the data need?

### Output requirements
The problem will have some explicit output requirements. What does the user need the application to provide?

Identiying the output requirements, will help determine the data needed, and identify any missing data.
