# Analyse the Problem

```{admonition} Tools used:
:class: attention
- mind maps
- UML Use Case Diagram
```
## Introduction
To analyse the problem we use our understanding of **computational thinking** and **systems thinking** to decompose the problem and define the scope.

We use mind maps to create a basic sketch of our understanding of the problem.

We use the UML Use Case Diagram to help identify the scope of the program and the processes involved.

```{admonition} Unit 1 subject matter covered:
- understand methods of breaking down problems into parts using computational thinking and thinking tools
- analyse problems to identify essential elements, components and features of problems in Digital Solutions
- analyse problems to identify where and how digital technologies are used to solve problems to meet personal, societal and organisational needs
- explore existing solutions to similar problems
- analyse a given problem to identify the boundary or scope of the problem
- analyse a given problem to identify missing, required or unnecessary facts or information

```

```{admonition} Unit 2 subject matter covered:
- determine manageable aspects of a problem through decomposition, pattern recognition and analysis of programming options including data models, and storage and output requirements
- analyse problems associated with data insertion, including variations in data formats, data structures, validation rules and data requirements
{cite}`queenslandcurriculumassessmentauthority_2017_digital`
```

```{admonition} Unit 3 subject matter covered:
- analyse a problem to identify and explain the elements of a system, the observable interactions, the inputs and outputs, the control mechanism, and the processes and interactions using logical diagrams and consistent symbols
- analyse problems and information to determine manageable aspects of the problem,
- analyse problems and information to determine a specific aspect of the problem to develop
- analyse problems and information to determine and describe interactions in terms of inputs, processes and outputs
- analyse problems and information to determine and explore data sources to understand relational and flat file data structures
- recognise and compare different file formats and data structures appropriate to the context
- determine file formats and data structures appropriate to the technology context

```{admonition} Unit 4 subject matter covered:
- analyse problems and information to determine necessary coded modularity and features
- analyse problems and information to determine factors and risks that affect data security, including confidentiality, integrity and availability, and privacy
- analyse problems and information to determine existing code within inbuilt libraries
- determine manageable aspects of a problem through a decomposition and analysis of risks
- determine manageable aspects of a problem through a decomposition and analysis of available tools and code libraries
- determine manageable aspects of a problem through a decomposition and analysis of data interface
- determine data sources required to generate data components
