# Identify Requirements

```{admonition} Tools used:
:class: attention
- mind maps
- requirments table
```

At this stage of the exploration you should have a clear idea of what the project demands of you. You need to explicitly state the requirements in your mind map, and then categorise them as must, should, could, won't in the requirements table.

```{admonition} Unit 1 subject matter covered:
- analyse a given problem to identify the requirements of the solution
- analyse a given problem to identify the user perspective and user-experience requirements
- analyse a given problem to identify technical issues of the problem that influence the user-interface requirements
```

```{admonition} Unit 2 subject matter covered:
- recognise the elements needed for a data-driven solution, including programming requirements, e.g. SQL  and algorithms
- recognise the elements needed for a data-driven solution, including system requirements, e.g. platforms, connections, hardware and data stores
- recognise the elements needed for a data-driven solution, including the data that is required from real-world data sources, e.g. files, peripheral devices, online sources and users
```

```{admonition} Unit 4 subject matter covered:
- determine manageable aspects of a problem through a decomposition and analysis of data storage and output requirements
```
