# Unit 1: Analyse the Problem

## Computational thinking
Computational thinking describes the processes and approaches we draw on when thinking about how a computer can help us to solve complex problems and create systems. We often draw on logical reasoning, algorithms, decomposition, abstraction, and patterns and generalisation when thinking computationally. {cite}`digital_technologies_hub_2022`

### Decomposition
Decomposition is the process of breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. With decomposition, problems that 
seem overwhelming at first become much more manageable. Problems we encounter are ultimately comprised of smaller problems we can more easily address. This process of breaking down problems enables us to analyze the different aspects of them, ground our thinking, and guide ourselves to an end point.

When decomposing, ask:
- What are the different parts of the problem you are trying to solve?
- What are the different tasks that I need to do to solve this problem?
- Can I easily complete each of tasks? If not, how can they be broken down further?
- If I complete all the sub-tasks, will the problem be solved?
