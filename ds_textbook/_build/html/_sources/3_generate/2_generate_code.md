- generate a prototype digital solution to access, manipulate and display data in an interactive media that validates the data to be entered for reliability to ensure that the data is valid for use and storage
- generate a prototype digital solution to access, manipulate and display data in an interactive media that includes user interfaces that will enable the insertion, updating and Selection of data from/to a database
- generate a prototype digital solution to access, manipulate and display data in an interactive media that creates procedural code to control user interaction, data validation, execution of SQL  queries, manipulation and display of query results through the user interface
