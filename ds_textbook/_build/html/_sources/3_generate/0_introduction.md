# Generate Introduction
```{admonition} Tools used to complete the Generate phase:
:class: attention
- Mind Maps
- QT Designer
- Annotated Code
- Testing
```

The generate phase involves students using information, software, programming tools and skills, and systems and design thinking processes to create components of an identified digital solution. Students evaluate personal, social and economic impacts, components and digital solutions against criteria throughout the generate phase to make decisions and refine the user experience and technical operation of components of the solution.

```{admonition} To generate solutions, students:
- use design and systems thinking processes to synthesise acquired information, ideas and skills to
  - generate individual components of a preferred solution
  - generate and refine a preferred solution in response to new or existing information
- use design thinking to evaluate and respond to the results of alpha testing
- use systems and design thinking to construct a solution and communicate knowledge and understanding of the solution.{cite}`qcaa_2017_digital`
