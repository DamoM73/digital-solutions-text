# Use Gramma and Language Structures

## Gramma and Spell Checking
Please ensure that you use spelling and gramma checks in your documentation. 

## Annotating

Throughout the EDGE process you will need comment on visual elements. The correct way to do this is through annotations. 

Annotation has three elements:
1. An image you wish to comment on
2. A text box commenting on a feature of the image
3. An arrow pointing from the text box to the feature that it is commenting on.

Below is an example of annotation in relation to visual communication which we will address in Topic 2.
