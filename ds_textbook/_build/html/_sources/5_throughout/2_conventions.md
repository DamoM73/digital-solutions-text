# Use Project Conventions

## Audience
You are writing for a technical audience, not the general public. They will be expecting succinct statements rather than colourful language.

In simple terms:
- don't use a paragraph when you can use a sentence
- don't use a sentence if you can use a phrase
- don't use a phrase if you can use a word.

## Documentation structure
Your documentation needs to be structured. You should use section headings, a graphical elements to reinforce this structure. You do not need a cover page, nor table of contents. 

Your documentation should also adhere to Visual Communication Principles, and be presentable.

You have strict page limits. I must stop reading at the end of your page limit and anything after that point is considered as not submitted.

## Video structure

All videos should commence with an introduction containing:
- name
- project name (FIA1 or IA2 etc)
- type of video (technical proposal or low fidelity prototype)

All videos should finish with a brief conclusion.

All videos should have audio (please try to record somewhere quiet)
