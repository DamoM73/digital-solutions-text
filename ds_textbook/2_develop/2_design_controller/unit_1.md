# Unit 1: Design Algorithms

Algorithms are the commands that make up our programs.

There are 6 basic building blocks that an algorithm consists of. Each of them serve a particular purpose.

- **Sequence:** a number of instructions that are processed one after the other.
- **Assignment:** used to store the value of an expression into a variable. 
- **Condition:** the way that a computer asks a question which can only generate two possible responses: True (yes) or False (no).
- **Selection:** a statement that uses a condition to select, or determine, whether the next line of the program is to be executed.
- **Iteration:** the repetition of a number of instructions. These are generally referred to as loops and refer to a section of code that is repeated. 
- **Modularisation:** refers to the process of breaking a large, unwieldy programming task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules. Individual modules can then be cobbled together like building blocks to create a larger application.

In designing your algorithm, you will need to decide how to arrange these building block to achieve you outcome.

We will use a number of tools to do this:
- Activity Diagrams
- Class Diagrams
- Pseudocode
- IPO Tables
- Desk-checking

## Activity Diagrams
> Activity diagrams show the workflow from a start point to the finish point detailing the many decision paths that exist in the progression of events contained in the activity {cite}`sparxsystems_2022_activity`.

An activity diagram is made of of different components. Some of the most common components of an activity diagram include:
- **Action:** A step in the activity wherein the users or software perform a given task.
- **Decision node:** A conditional branch in the flow that includes a single input and two or more outputs.
- **Control flows:** Another name for the connectors that show the flow between steps in the diagram.
- **Start node:** Symbolizes the beginning of the activity.
- **End node:** Represents the final step in the activity.

## Class Diagrams
> Class diagrams clearly map out the structure of a particular system by modelling its classes, attributes, operations, and relationships between objects {cite}`lucidchart_2017_uml`.

Class diagrams are particularly useful when using Object Orientated Programming.

The standard class diagram is composed of three sections:
- **Upper section:** Contains the name of the class. This section is always required.
- **Middle section:** Contains the attributes of the class. Use this section to describe the qualities of the class.
- **Bottom section:** Includes class operations (methods). Displayed in list format, each operation takes up its own line.
