# Design Data Source

```{admonition} Tools used to complete the Develop phase:
:class: attention
- Data Flow Diagrams
- Entity Relationship Diagrams
- Data Dictionaries
- Relational Schemas
```

```{admonition} Unit 2 subject matter covered:
- recognise data types, constraints, and primary and foreign keys
- symbolise the links between external entities, data sources, data flow, processes and data storage in annotated context diagrams or data flow diagrams
- understand SQL syntax and use SQL statements to solve a problem
- understand that data is organised in tabular form and the skills and knowledge used to normalise and link tables together
- understand the reasons and methods of database structure modification to third normal form (3NF)
- interpret the structure of a database represented by a relational schema (RS) to determine the relationship between data
- explain data principles including acquisition, organisation, representation, integrity, redundancy, and security
- explain the difference between data validation and data verification
- explain referential integrity, normalisation and third normal form, relational database management system
- explain the difference between primary key and foreign key
- explain relations (tables) including rows; columns; primary, secondary and foreign keys; nulls; and views within a database management system
- symbolise data flow through a system using data flow diagrams
- analyse and structure data and data stores to reduce redundancy and ensure completeness, consistency and integrity for use and storage
- apply data management processes, e.g. encryption, consistency, searching, pattern recognition and de-identification
- determine appropriate data types, constraints, and primary and foreign keys
- evaluate and modify a database structure to third normal form (3NF)

```{admonition} Unit 3 subject matter covered:
- symbolise, explain and use advanced data processes, including table joins, referential integrity, redundancy reduction and anomaly updating
- apply data algorithms for cleaning and merging data sources and iterating through data records
```

```{admonition} Unit 4 subject matter covered:
- recognise and describe encryption and authentication strategies appropriate for securing data transmissions and their differences
- recognise and describe features of symmetric (Data Encryption Standard — DES, Triple DES, AES — Advanced Encryption Standard, Blowfish and Twofish) and assymetric (RSA) encryption algorithms
- recognise and describe how data compression, encryption and hashing are used in the storage and transfer of data
- explain Australian Privacy Principles (2014) and ethics applicable to the use of personally identifiable or sensitive data from a digital systems perspective
- explain network transmission principles, including latency, jitter, guarantee and timeliness of delivery, and protocols relevant to the transmission of data over the internet, e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, VPN, streaming and broadcasting data packets
- explain methods for data exchange used to transfer data across networked systems including REST, JSON and XML
- symbolise, analyse and evaluate Caesar, Polyalphabetic (e.g. Vigenere and Gronsfield), and one-time pad encryption algorithms
- describe data using appropriate naming conventions, data formats and structures
- symbolise and explain secure data transmission techniques and processes, including the use of encryption, decryption, authentication, hashing and checksums
