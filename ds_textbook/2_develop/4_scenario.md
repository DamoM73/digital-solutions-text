## Unit 1 Scenario
Meet Mikey. Mikey is a 30 year-old guy who rents an inner city unit and works in customer support. He is currently saving up to travel to Scotland to see his favourite Pirate Metal band Alestorm. He hopes one day to own a unit.

Mikey is not really a go-getter, and appreciated that his he can leave his work behind at the end of the day. He aims to lead a stress-free life, and loves to relax.

Mikey in an introvert, and he finds that by the end of his day, he is "all talked out". He's rarely in the mood for socialising during the work week, and just wants to "decompress" at home. 

On a recent camping trip Mikey rediscovered hangman. Sure, he played the game at school, but he never realised how much he enjoyed playing it. He really enjoys the challenge of solving problems, and the low stakes nature of hangman means is all just about fun. 

He would love nothing more than coming home each day and playing hangman to relax, but that would involve interacting with people. Mikey is looking for a way to play hangman by himself.

Mikey is concerned that if he had hangman on his phone, that he would play it at work. Therefore he is looking for a solution that would only reside on his laptop. He knows that he can buy a hangman game, but he cannot afford it.

## Unit 2 Scenario
Things have changed in Mikey's life since we last worked for him. All the previous details are still relevant, but there are new aspects to consider.

First Mikey is now in a relationship, and it is getting serious. His partner, who is also interested in Hang Man, has moved in. Mikey would like to setup the game with different users so his partner can play whilst not ruining Mikey's record.

Speaking of records, Mikey would like to start viewing some stats about his hangman playing. Specifically he would like to know: how many games he has played, how many lost, how many won, and the win-loss percentage. He would also like to know what was the longest word he's guessed, and which word he has missed the most. He wants to change the game so it doesn't repeat a word once he has guessed it.

Mikey has also found a dictionary spreadsheet with more words than the current list, so he would like the program to use this. This spreadsheet has other details that he thinks might be useful, but he's not sure how to use them yet.
