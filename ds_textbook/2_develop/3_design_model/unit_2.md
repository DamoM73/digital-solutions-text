# Unit 2: Design Data Source

## Scenario
The first step in designing a database is developing an understanding of the scenario. For learning about designing databases we will use the following example:

**Student Subject Database**
- Students can log into to access:
  - their current enrolment
  - subject grades when entered
- Teachers can log into to:
  - Enter student grades
- Each subject is only offered once, with one teacher
- Each student can enrol in each subject only once.

## Data Flow Diagram
