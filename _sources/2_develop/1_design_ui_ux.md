# Design UI and UX

```{admonition} Tools used:
:class: attention 
- XD Mock-ups
- QT Designer Mock-ups
```
## For Units 1 to 4
In designing our UI and UX we need to incorporate **Useability Principles**.

Useability Principles are:
- **Accessibility:** the ability to be used by many different people, even people with disabilities
- **Effectiveness:** the ability of users to use the system to do the work they need to do
- **Safety:** the ability for users to make errors and recover from the mistake. 
- **Utility:** the ability of the system to provide all the functionality that users need.
- **Learnability:** concerned with how easy a system is to learn.

The design of the UI is shown through an **annotated mockup**

```{admonition} Unit 1 subject matter covered:
- recognise and describe the meaning and importance of user experience
- recognise and describe useability principles including accessibility, effectiveness, safety, utility and learnability
- explore existing user interfaces to identify pitfalls and useful solutions
- explore existing user interfaces to determine how user characteristics influence the user-interface requirements and user experience for problems and solutions in relation to the useability principles
- symbolise ideas for a user interface using sketches, diagrams, schematic diagrams or mock-ups

```{admonition} Unit 2 subject matter covered:
- explore and use the elements and principles of visual communication elements are limited to space, line, colour, shape, texture, tone, form, proportion and scale
- explore and use the elements and principles of visual communication principles are limited to balance, contrast, proximity, harmony, alignment, repetition and hierarchy

```

```{admonition} Unit 3 subject matter covered:
- recognise and describe user-interface components such as user hardware and peripheral devices used for input and output
- symbolise and explain a variety of interfaces
- appraise user interfaces against useability principles
- generate low-fidelity user-interface prototypes appropriate to the digital context by using the elements and principles of visual communication such as sketches, mood boards, storyboards, sitemaps, wireframes and mock-ups
