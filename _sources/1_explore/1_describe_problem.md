# Describe the Problem
```{admonition} Tools used:
:class: attention
- mind maps
```
## For Unit 1
Once we have established that the a digital solution is applicable to the problem, it is important to have a clear understanding of what the problem is.

We use the project mind map to decompose the problem. Our first step is to describe the problem with a problem statement.

## For Units 2 to 4
In addition to the Unit 1 requirements, you must incorporate the problem's data driven nature as part of the problem description.
