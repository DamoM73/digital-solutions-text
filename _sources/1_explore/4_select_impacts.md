## For Units 2 to 4
In addition to the impacts from Unit 1, you can also consider the impacts that result from the use of data. 

Consider impact resulting from:
- Transparency, accountability and empowerment of users
- Business opportunities including for data intermediaries and start-ups
- Co-operation and competition across sectors and countries
- Crowdsourcing new insights and user-driven innovation
- Increased efficiency across society through data linkage and integration

These impacts will still be recorded within the categories of personal, social, economic and environmental on the mind map.
