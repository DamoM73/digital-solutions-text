## Unit 1 Scenario
Meet Mikey. Mikey is a 30 year-old guy who rents an inner city unit and works in customer support. He is currently saving up to travel to Scotland to see his favourite Pirate Metal band Alestorm. He hope one day to own a unit.

Mikey is not really a go-getter, and likes that his he can leave his work at work. He aims to lead a stress-free life, and loves to relax.
Mikey in an introvert, and he finds that by the end of his day, he is "all talked out". He's rarely in the mood for socialising during the work week, and just wants to "decompress" at home. 

On a recent camping trip Mikey rediscovered hangman. Sure, he played the game at school, but he never realised how much he enjoyed playing it. He really enjoys the challenge of solving a problem, and the low stakes nature of hangman means is all just about fun. 

He would love nothing more than coming home each day and playing hangman to relax, but that would involve interacting with people. Mikey is looking for a way to play hangman by himself.

Mikey is concerned that if he had hangman on his phone, that he would play it at work. Therefore he is looking for a solution that would only reside on his laptop. He knows that he can buy a hangman game, but he cannot afford it.
