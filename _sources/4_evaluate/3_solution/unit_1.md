# Unit 1: Evaluate Solution

The solution evaluation occurs in relation to the prescribed and self-determined criteria that you developed in the Exploration phase.

You should create a Solutions Evaluation table for both the prescribed criteria and the self-determined criteria (like the one below).

Copy all the of the requirements and criteria from the Explore section.

In the Rating column assess how well you met the criteria.

Finally add recommendations. These may be to improvements that would meet failed criteria, or extensions that you would like to do if you had more time.
