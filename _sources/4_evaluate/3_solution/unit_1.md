# Unit 1: Evaluate Solution

The solution evaluation occurs in relation to the prescribed and self-determined criteria that you developed in the Exploration phase.

You should create a Solutions Evaluation table for both the prescribed criteria and the self-determined criteria (like the one below).

Copy all the of the requirements and criteria from the Explore section.

In the Rating column assess how well you met the criteria. You can derive this rating through two means:

- **testing** - if the criteria is objective (eg. file is saved to disk) you need to test if the criteria passes and then display the results as the rating.
- **survey** - if the criteria is subjective (eg. the UI meets the  learnability useability principle) then you need to survey users to establish your rating. This survey should be combined with the UI component evaluation.

Finally add recommendations. These may be to improvements that would meet failed criteria, or extensions that you would like to do if you had more time.
