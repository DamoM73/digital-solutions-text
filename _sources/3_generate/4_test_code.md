# Test Code

```{admonition} Tools use:
:class: attention 
- Integrated Testing Table
- Unit Testing Table
```

## For Units 1 to 4
You will need to test the code that you have generated to ensure the reliability of your code.

During the generate phase your will need to undertake both:
- Integrated testing
- Unit testing

The results of these tests should be recorded in two tables

```{admonition} Unit 1 subject matter covered:
- test inputs, outputs and processes
{cite}`queenslandcurriculumassessmentauthority_2017_digital`
```

```{admonition} Unit 2 subject matter covered:
- test the SQL , algorithm and procedural code components of the prototype digital solution for reliability, maintainability and efficiency
- test the user interfaces against useability principles
{cite}`queenslandcurriculumassessmentauthority_2017_digital`
```

```{admonition} Unit 3 subject matter covered:
- evaluate by testing program modules for reliability, maintainability and efficiency using computational thinking processes such as debugging to refine a prototype digital solution
{cite}`queenslandcurriculumassessmentauthority_2017_digital`
```

```{admonition} Unit 4 subject matter covered:
- evaluate solutions by testing to refine their accuracy, reliability, maintainability, efficiency, effectiveness and useability
