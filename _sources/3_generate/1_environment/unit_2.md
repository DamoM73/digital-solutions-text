# Unit 2: Select Development Environment

## Database Management System

Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data. A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database. 

In Unit 2 we will working with databases using SQL (Structured Query Language), in particular a version caller SQLite. Ultimately in Unit 3 we will designing and developing our own DBMS, but for Unit 2 we will use a lightweight DBMS called [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).
